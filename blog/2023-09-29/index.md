# Hey there, Difree Community!

We've got some exciting news to share that's going to make your writing experience even more enjoyable – we've added in Difree 0.9.4 two awesome monospaced fonts, iAWriterMono and Courier New, to Difree! 🚀

## 🤔 Why Monospaced Fonts?

You might be wondering, "Why monospaced fonts?" Well, there are some great reasons:

**🔪 Precision and Clarity:** Monospaced fonts have a unique characteristic – each character takes up the same horizontal space. This uniformity ensures that every letter, number, and symbol lines up neatly in your writing, whether it's code, a poem, or an essay. This precision can be a game-changer, especially when you're crafting structured documents or working on projects that demand impeccable alignment.

**🧑‍💻 Coding Bliss:** If you're a coder, you're probably well-acquainted with monospaced fonts. They're a coder's best friend because they make code more readable. Each indent, space, and line lines up perfectly, making it easier to spot errors and understand the logic.

**🤩 Inspired by iA Writer:** You may have heard of the writing app [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). It's renowned for its minimalist design and distraction-free writing environment. The fonts used in iA Writer contribute to this distraction-free vibe. They create an elegant and professional look on the page that's conducive to focused writing.

**⏳ Courier New's Timeless Appeal:** Speaking of classics, Courier New has been a beloved monospaced font for generations. It's a timeless choice for writers and typists alike due to its legibility and balanced spacing. When you want a font that's trusted and versatile, Courier New is a go-to option.
