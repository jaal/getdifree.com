Difree as an extension is lightning fast. Web apps can sometimes be slow and clunky. But Difree works smoothly and quickly. It fits right into your Chrome browser, so you don't have to wait for it to load. When you're in the writing zone, speed matters, and Difree keeps up.

## Playing by the Rules

We created Difree as a Chrome extension, which means we have to follow certain rules set by Chrome. These rules ensure that Difree is safe and works well with your browser. You can trust Difree to be reliable and easy to use.
