⭢ 0.3.1
We focused our efforts on resolving the issues with opening more than one instance of Difree.

⭢ 0.2.9
We focused our efforts on:
1. Building feedback solution for people using Difree,
2. Implementing dedicated framework.
We added a way to easily feedback us or ask question. In the bottom-right corner, there's a question mark button. When clicked, it opens a popup where you can send feedback.
We changed framework, we build Difree. This will help us easily introduce new views in Difree, which we definitely will do, as we have plans to add more useful features.

⭢ 0.2.8
1. We focused our efforts on improving your experience in Difree and getting to know better how Difree performs.
2. Add Clear button
- The button helps you to clear the editor from text; instead of selecting all text and deleting it, use Clear button
3. Add Introduction to Difree
- When you install Difree, it opens with short introduction of the features.
4. Add statistics
- We implement tracking statistics. We have done it because we would like to know what's working and what's not in Difree, to improve Difree.
- We collect following events: open of Difree, time spent in Difree, click on buttons Copy, Clear and Close.
- We use Matomo to gather the data, and we have full control of the data.
- We still DON'T know what you write, and we DON'T want to. We prefer the approach 'your data is none of our business'. Our privacy policy is pretty strict about it, the privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. Here's a link to our privacy policy: https://www.getdifree.com/privacy-policy/
